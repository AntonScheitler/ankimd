# what is this
this is an anki plugin which allows the user to import markdown files as flashcards.
the delimiters for the front and back of cards are !\ and !\\ by default and can be changed at will.
error handling is non-existent as of right now.
if it doesn't work for you that probably means the format of your .md file is incorrect.
i'll try to work on that in the future
